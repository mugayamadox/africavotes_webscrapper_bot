# africavotes_webscrapper_bot
A one day project focused on webscraping and data visualiztion #towards data science

# project rationale
This is a simple project built as practise for my data science carrier
I was so excited to finally find a live soure of data that can be visualized.
It so happened that the Kigezi miss tourism contest was running. I was curious to get my hards dirty and add some paint to the canvas.

# why the project
On a technical level, i wanted to test the reliability of webscraping and data visualization tools to make sense of actionable data.

# the expected result
I envisioned a realtime bot that scrapes data from africavotes.com and then produce a barchart showing the contestants and correspoding votes

# Futures plan.
Have a realtime monitor and visualizer of votes simmilar to the stocks ticker.


# Dependencies
1. mechanicalsoup
2. matplotlib
