**africavotes_webscrapper_bot**
A one day project focused on webscraping and data visualiztion #towards data science

**project rationale**
This is a simple project built as practise for my data science carrier
I was so excited to finally find a live soure of data that can be visualized.
It so happened that the Kigezi miss tourism contest was running. I was curious to get my hards dirty and add some paint to the canvas.

**why the project**
On a technical level, i wanted to test the reliability of webscraping and data visualization tools to make sense of actionable data.

**the expected result**
I envisioned a realtime bot that scrapes data from africavotes.com and then produce a barchart showing the contestants and correspoding votes

**Futures plan.**
Have a realtime monitor and visualizer of votes simmilar to the stocks ticker.


**Dependencies**
1. mechanicalsoup
2. matplotlib

**the bot has three main sub units**
1. a crawler
2. a data cleaner
3. a visualizer
4. 
**Data source:
[Africa votes](https://africavotes.com/p/miss.and.mr.tourism.kigezi.region.2024)**
